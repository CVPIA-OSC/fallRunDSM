## Usage

### Package Installation
The `fallRunDSM` package depends on a number of packages developed by the [CVPIA Open Science Collaborative](https://github.com/CVPIA-OSC). 
To install `fallRunDSM` and additional `CVPIA-OSC` packages use the `remotes::install_github()` function. 

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("CVPIA-OSC/fallRunDSM")
remotes::install_github("CVPIA-OSC/DSMscenario")

# optional - need if calibrating model
remotes::install_github("CVPIA-OSC/DSMCalibrationData")

# optional - need if wanting to explore or modify flow, habitat, and temperature inputs
remotes::install_github("CVPIA-OSC/DSMflow")
remotes::install_github("CVPIA-OSC/DSMhabitat")
remotes::install_github("CVPIA-OSC/DSMtemperature")
```

### Run Model
The `fall_run_model()` is a Fall Run Chinook life cycle model used for [CVPIA's Structured Decision Making Process](http://cvpia.scienceintegrationteam.com/).
Running the model simulates Fall Run Chinook population dynamics across 31 watersheds in California over a 20 year period. 

The following code runs the fall run model with SIT defined scenario 1:
```r
# seed the model
fall_run_seeds <- fall_run_model(mode = "seed")

# run the 20 year simulation
results <- fall_run_model(scenario = DSMscenario::scenarios$ONE,
                          mode = "simulate",
                          seeds = fall_run_seeds)
```

The following code runs the fall run model with a custom scenario defined in `scenario_df`:
```r
# define scenario
scenario_df <- data.frame(watershed = c("Upper Sacramento River", "Battle Creek"),
                          action = c(3, 2),
                          start_year = c(1980, 1979),
                          end_year = c(1989, 1988),
                          units_of_effort = c(1, 2))

# create scenario input
scenario <- DSMscenario::get_action_matrices(scenario_df)

# seed model
fall_run_seeds <- fall_run_model(mode = "seed")

# evaluate the impact of your scenario over the 20 year simulation
results <- fall_run_model(scenario = scenario,
                          mode = "simulate",
                          seeds = fall_run_seeds)
```

## Details on Supporting Data

### Dependencies
The `fallRunDSM` package uses data from several other packages within the [CVPIA Open Science Collaborative](https://github.com/CVPIA-OSC). These relationships are visualized in the dependency graph below.

### Flow, Habitat, and Temperature Data

All data used in the `fallRunDSM` is passed in as a argument to `fall_run_model()` from a `fallRunDSM::params` data list that is composed of data objects from the following packages:

* **Flow Data**: View detailed documentation of flow data inputs at [DSMflow](https://cvpia-osc.github.io/DSMflow/). Flow inputs to the `fallRunDSM` are generated using CalSim 2 data.
* **Habitat Data**: View detailed documentation of habitat data inputs at [DSMhabitat](https://cvpia-osc.github.io/DSMhabitat/). Modeling details for each stream can be viewed [here](https://cvpia-osc.github.io/DSMhabitat/reference/habitat_data.html#modeling-details-for-streams).
* **Temperature Data**: View detailed documentation of temperature data inputs at [DSMtemperature](https://cvpia-osc.github.io/DSMtemperature/). Modeling details for each stream can be viewed [here](https://cvpia-osc.github.io/DSMtemperature/reference/stream_temperature.html#watershed-modeling-details).

### Scenario Functionality

Running scenarios through the `fall_run_model()` model the impact of restoration actions on Fall Run Chinook populations. 
The [CVPIA SIT (Science Integration Team)](http://cvpia.scienceintegrationteam.com/) has developed restoration action portfolios composed of actions preformed on watersheds over a set time period. 

There are seven predefined scenarios that were developed by the CVPIA SIT. Additional scenarios can be defined by creating a `scenario_df` describing watershed, action, start year, end year, and units of effort. The function `get_action_matrices()` takes a user defined `scenario_df` and returns a scenario in the correct format to be used as the `scenario` input for `fall_run_model()`. For additional description on how to build a scenario view `load_scenario()` documentation by searching `?DSMscenario::load_scenario()`  

### Calibration Data

We prepared additional datasets in the `DSMCalibration` package for model calibration:

1. [GrandTab](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Fishes/Chinook-Salmon/Anadromous-Assessment) estimated escapement data for the years 1998-2017. The GrandTab data is prepared as `DSMCalibrationData::grandtab_observed` and is used to measure the difference between model predictions and observed escapements. Grandtab data is additionally prepared as `DSMCalibrationData::grandtab_imputed` and is used to calculate the number of juveniles during the 20 year simulation.

2. Proxy years are used to select Habitat, Flow, and Temperature data for 1998-2017 to correspond with the years of GrandTab escapement data. The data inputs to the DSM are for years 1980-1999. We selected proxy years for 1998-2017 from the 1980-1999 model inputs by [comparing the DWR water year indices](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=WSIHIST).
