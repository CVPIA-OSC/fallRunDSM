\arguments{
\item{juveniles}{An n by 4 matrix of juvenile fish size s, m, l, vl}

\item{inchannel_habitat}{The available tributary habitat in square meters}

\item{floodplain_habitat}{The available floodplain habitat in square meters (NULL for bypasses and delta)}

\item{territory_size}{A length 4 array of juvenile fish territory requirements s, m, l, vl}

\item{up_to_size_class}{Which size class and under is moved to floodplain and
inchannel habitat (small = 1, medium = 2, large = 3, very large = 4)}
}
\description{
Allocates juvenile fish onto the floodplain, in-channel, and once
available habitat is full, assigns fish to out migrate.
The \code{fill_natal} function is used to route fish within their natal tributary
and the \code{fill_regional} function is used to route fish on the mainstem, bypasses, and deltas.
