<p>Temporal Range: 2010 - 2012</p>
<p>Most data were obtained from CWT (coded wire tag) analyses with
limited data in 2010 from CVPIA ChinookProd Database Version 2,
September 22, 2017. Data from these sources were compiled in a csv
called <a href="https://dsm-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/adult_hatchery_documentation/hatchery_fish_fate2010_2012.csv" class="external-link">hatchery_fish_fate2010_2012.csv</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustment to Feather and Yuba Rivers:</strong></p>
<p>Feather and Yuba Rivers do not separate spring and fall run in
totals. Here, we apply the proportion of spring hatchery return adults
to adjust the totals for 2010 - 2012. Data used for Feather and Yuba
adjustment were from <a href="https://dsm-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/adult_hatchery_documentation/GrandTab.2017.04.07.pdf" class="external-link">GrandTab
2017 version.</a></p>
<p>The data table below shows the prepped data for analysis.
(<code>No_hatch_returns</code> corresponds to the number of hatchery
fish returning, <code>Hatch_flag</code> describes if fish are
hatchery(1) or not hatchery(0))</p>
