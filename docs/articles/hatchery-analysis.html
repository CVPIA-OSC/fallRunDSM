<p>Temporal Range: 2010 - 2012</p>
<p>Most data from CWT (coded wire tag) analyses with limited data in 2010 from CVPIA ChinookProd database version 2 September 22, 2017. Data from these sources was compiled in a csv called <a href="https://dsm-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/adult_hatchery_documentation/hatchery_fish_fate2010_2012.csv">hatchery_fish_fate2010_2012.csv</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Adjustment to Feather and Yuba Rivers:</strong></p>
<p>Feather and Yuba Rivers do not separate spring and fall run in totals, here we apply the proportion of spring hatchery return adults that are used to adjust the totals for 2010 - 2012. Data used for Feather and Yuba adjustment were from <a href="https://dsm-docs.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/adult_hatchery_documentation/GrandTab.2017.04.07.pdf">GrandTab 2017 version.</a></p>
<p>The datatable below shows the data that has been prepped for analysis. (<code>No_hatch_returns</code> corresponds to the number of hatchery fish returning, <code>Hatch_flag</code> describes if fish are hatchery(1) or not hatchery(0))</p>
