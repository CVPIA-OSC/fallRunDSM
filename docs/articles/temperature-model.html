<p>This data was prepped to model the proportion of days in a month with temps &gt; 20 Â°C and if temperature will go above 25 Â°C using logistic regression.</p>
<p>To allow for logistic regression model use we made the following edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>We adjusted zeros to .001 of and 1â€™s to .999.</li>
<li>We appended an additional column to our data containing the odds ratio by taking takes <code>log(Proportion Exceeding 20/(1 - Proportion Exceeding 20))</code>.</li>
<li>We edited our <code>Number of Measures Exceeding 25 degrees</code> to create a binary column describing when temperature exceeds 25 in a month (1) and when temperature does not exceed 25 in a month (0).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Finding <code>avgT20</code> and <code>avgT20D</code> in DSM models:</strong> In the DSM models <code>avgT20</code> and <code>avgT20D</code> is estimated for each month using a logistic model.</p>
<p><strong>Logistic Model Input:</strong> The numeric input to our logistic models for CV and Delta temperatures is based on coefficients generated by fitting a linear model on the <code>odds_ratio</code> and <code>month_mean_temp</code>. We take the sum of our linear model intercept and slope and multiply this by the month mean temperature to find the numeric input for our CV rivers and Delta logistic models:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>CV Logistic Regression</strong>: Numeric Input = <code>-14.3877186</code> + <code>0.7191858</code> * <code>month mean temperature</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Delta Logistic Regression</strong>: Numeric Input = <code>-18.1256657</code> + <code>0.9521234</code> * <code>month mean temperature</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The scatterplots below show the mean monthly temperature and the proportion of measures greater than 20 degrees for the Delta and Central Valley Rivers. The red line is our logistic model prediction based on the numeric input defined above (<code>boot::inv.logit(Numeric Input)</code>):</p>

<p><strong>Finding <code>maxT25</code> and <code>maxT25D</code> in DSM models:</strong> In the DSM models <code>maxT25</code> and <code>maxT25D</code> is calculated for each month using a logistic model.</p>
<p><strong>Logistic model input:</strong> The numeric input to our logistic models for CV and Delta temperature exceeding 25Â°C is based on coefficients generated by fitting a generalized linear model on the <code>count_gt_25</code> and <code>month_mean_temp</code>. We take the sum of our linear model intercept and slope and multiply this by the month mean temperature to find the numeric input for our CV rivers and Delta logistic models:</p>
<ul>
