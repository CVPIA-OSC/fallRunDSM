<p>Within the <code><a href="../reference/get_rearing_survival.html">get_rearing_survival()</a></code> DSM submodel,
<code>aveT20</code>, <code>aveT20D</code>, <code>maxT25</code>, and
<code>maxT25D</code> are defined as inverse logit models whose inputs
are monthly stream temperatures. The purpose of these models is to
provide a sub monthly metric derived from monthly data, and these
metrics are needed to calculate survival probabilities. The script below
outlines the parameterization process of these models.</p>

<p>This data was prepped to model the proportion of days in a month with
temperature over 20 °C. If the temperature goes above 25 °C, logistic
regression was used to model this phenomenon.</p>
<p>To allow for logistic regression model use, we made the following
edits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We adjusted 0’s to .001 and 1’s to .999.</p></li>
<li><p>We appended an additional column to our data containing the odds
ratio by taking
<code>log(Proportion Exceeding 20/(1 - Proportion Exceeding 20))</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>We edited our
<code>Number of Measures Exceeding 25 degrees</code> to create a binary
column describing when the temperature exceeds 25 in a month (1) and
when the temperature does not exceed 25 in a month (0).</p></li>
</ul>

month<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#results-proportion-of-days-where-temperature-exceedes-20c-in-a-month"></a>
</h4>
<p>We parameterized the model for the proportion of days where the
temperature exceeds 20°C in a month by fitting a linear regression model
between the log odds of the proportion of days in a month greater than
20°C, and the monthly mean temperature. The logit values resulting from
this are converted back into proportions using the
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/boot/man/inv.logit.html" class="external-link">boot::inv.logit</a></code>. The resulting models are,</p>
<p><strong>Delta</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ prop = inv.logit(-18.18765 + 0.9560903
\times temperature)\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Central Valley</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ prop = inv.logit(-14.36524 + 0.7178891
\times temperature)\]</span></p>
<p>The scatter plots below show the mean monthly temperature and the
proportion of measures greater than 20°C for the Delta and Central
Valley Rivers. The red line is our logistic model prediction where the
monthly temperature ranges between 5°C and 25°C.</p>

</h4>
<p>The model for predicting when the temperature exceeds 25°C during a
month is fit using a logistic regression where we regress the binary
variable representing an occurrence of temperature greater than 25°C
onto corresponding mean monthly temperature.</p>
<p>The resulting models are:</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[P_{&gt; 25} = inv.logit(-18.66548 +

<p><span class="math display">\[P_{&gt; 25} = inv.logit(-155.563 +
6.910016 \times temperature)\]</span></p>
<p>The scatter plots below show if temp exceeds 25°C for a given mean
monthly temperature in the Delta and Central Valley Rivers. The red line
is our logistic model prediction based on the numeric input defined
above (<code>boot::inv.logit(Numeric Input)</code>):
