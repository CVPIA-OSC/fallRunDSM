<p>Within the <code><a href="../reference/get_rearing_survival.html">get_rearing_survival()</a></code> DSM submodel, <code>aveT20</code>, <code>aveT20D</code>, <code>maxT25</code>, and <code>maxT25D</code> are defined as inverse logit models whose inputs are monthly stream temperatures. The purpose of these models is to provide a sub monthly metric derived from monthly data, and these metrics are needed to calculate survival probabilities. The script below outlines the parameterization process of these models.</p>

<p>This data was prepped to model the proportion of days in a month with temperature over 20 Â°C. If the temperature goes above 25 Â°C, logistic regression was used to model this phenomenon.</p>
<p>To allow for logistic regression model use, we made the following edits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We adjusted 0â€™s to .001 and 1â€™s to .999.</p></li>
<li><p>We appended an additional column to our data containing the odds ratio by taking <code>log(Proportion Exceeding 20/(1 - Proportion Exceeding 20))</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>We edited our <code>Number of Measures Exceeding 25 degrees</code> to create a binary column describing when the temperature exceeds 25 in a month (1) and when the temperature does not exceed 25 in a month (0).</p></li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>We parameterized the model for the proportion of days where the temperature exceeds 20Â°C in a month by fitting a linear regression model between the log odds of the proportion of days in a month greater than 20Â°C, and the monthly mean temperature. The logit values resulting from this are converted back into proportions using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/boot/man/inv.logit.html" class="external-link">boot::inv.logit</a></code>. The resulting models are,</p>
<p><strong>Delta</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ prop = inv.logit(-18.18765 + 0.9560903 \times temperature)\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Central Valley</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ prop = inv.logit(-14.36524 + 0.7178891 \times temperature)\]</span></p>
<p>The scatter plots below show the mean monthly temperature and the proportion of measures greater than 20Â°C for the Delta and Central Valley Rivers. The red line is our logistic model prediction where the monthly temperature ranges between 5Â°C and 25Â°C.</p>

</h3>
<p>The model for predicting when the temperature exceeds 25Â°C during a month is fit using a logistic regression where we regress the binary variable representing an occurrence of temperature greater than 25Â°C onto corresponding mean monthly temperature.</p>
<p>The resulting models are:</p>
<p><strong>Central Valley</strong></p>

<p><span class="math display">\[P_{&gt; 25} = inv.logit(-155.563 + 6.910016 \times temperature)\]</span></p>
<p>The scatter plots below show if temp exceeds 25Â°C for a given mean monthly temperature in the Delta and Central Valley Rivers. The red line is our logistic model prediction based on the numeric input defined above (<code>boot::inv.logit(Numeric Input)</code>): <img src="temperature-model_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="1440"></p>
