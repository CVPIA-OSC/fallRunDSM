# fallRunDSM v2.1
fallRunDSM v2.1 is the Fall-run life cycle model used by the Science Integration Team as part of [CVPIA Structured Decision Making](http://cvpia.scienceintegrationteam.com/) process to evaluate priorities and information needs for management of anadromous fish in the Central Valley. A complete description of the model, model parameters and their source can be found in [Peterson and Duarte (2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rec.13244).

The V2.1 Updates include the following changes:

* New spawning decay process. More information [here](#)
* New growth transition matrices using a Bioenergetics model.
* New CALSIM flow values using Biop ITP 2018-2019 ruleset.
